# Azimutt browser extension

Goal of this extension:

- open Azimutt when clicking on it
- add a button in sql GitHub files to open them in Azimutt (ex: https://github.com/prisma/database-schema-examples/blob/main/postgres/basic-blog/schema.sql)

## Development

Do an `npm install` and then run `npm run dev` to build the extension in live.

To do a build you can do `npm run build` (needed when changing the manifest)
