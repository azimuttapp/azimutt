        Azimutt explorer has several ways to import your database schema. The suggested one is the <a href="#from-database">database connection</a>
        as it's more reliable and offers more features (see below) but you have many other options if you prefer.

    <%= render "docs/_h2.html", title: "From database" %>
    <p>
        This is the suggested way to import your database schema into Azimutt.
        In addition to being more reliable than parsing SQL, it's also more powerful and offer more features:
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect JSON columns and infer nested schema</li>
            <li>Detect polymorphic relations and extract kind values to suggest them in UI</li>
            <li>Extract statistics, showing table size and # rows, column most common values and index size...</li>
            <li>(soon) Query history when available to infer relations and table similarity</li>
        </ul>
        Also, with a database connection, you will be able to use the <a href={Routes.website_path(@conn, :doc, ["data-exploration"])}>Data exploration</a> feature of Azimutt.
        Quite awesome if you ask me ðŸ˜‰
    </p>
    <p>
        For more details, you can have a <a href={Routes.website_path(@conn, :connectors)}>look at the connectors</a> to see exactly what and how its being done, here are the scripts for

        Other connectors are of course also available in the repository.

        Your database URI is <strong>not</strong> sent to Azimutt server, just the Gateway.

    <%= render "docs/_h2.html", title: "From SQL" %>
    <p>
        If you just want to explore your database schema, you can upload it as SQL statements (CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, COMMENTS and others).
        You can do it safely as <strong>nothing will be sent to Azimutt servers</strong>,
        the parsing is made on the frontend and your schema is shown with no business data sent to Azimutt.

        you can <a href="https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an issue</a> (or vote on the existing ones),
        send a Pull Request (look at <a href="https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt/tree/main/libs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other connectors</a>) or
        extract its schema on your own and <a href={"#{Routes.elm_path(@conn, :new)}?json"} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">import it as JSON</a> in Azimutt.
        You just have to format it according to the JSON Schema below the import section.

        You can <a href={"#{Routes.elm_path(@conn, :create)}?aml"} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an empty project</a>
        and use <a href={Routes.website_path(@conn, :aml)}>AML</a> to design it.<br>

    <%= render "docs/_h2.html", title: "Import project" %>

        As Azimutt projects are "just a structured JSON", it's easy to <a href={"#{Routes.website_path(@conn, :doc, ["export"])}#full-project"}>export</a> and import them.
        This can be useful to version it in your code repository, share it with someone else without an Azimutt account
        or move it from an organization to another (if you started with your personal organization and want to move to your company one for example).

        When you create a project, no matter the way, it's created as a <strong>draft project</strong>, temporarily saved in your browser, and it don't even require an Azimutt account.
        To keep it for future use, you need to save it, and choose if you prefer to keep it stored in your browser or in the server.
        For that, you need an Azimutt account to keep, at least, your project reference.
