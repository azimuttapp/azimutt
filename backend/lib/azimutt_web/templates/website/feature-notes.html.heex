                    <p>Let's be honest, table and column names are often not enough to understand well what is stored, how it works and should be used.</p>
                    <p>We all don't like to write a lot of documentation, but leaving some contextual notes for the next users could save them a lot of pain.</p>
                    <p>Azimutt have 3 ways for this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>SQL comments</b>: they are read only from your database schema, if you have some or want to add some, that's awesome!</li>
                        <li><b>Notes</b>: they are like SQL comments, on tables or columns, but stored in Azimutt instead of the database. Easier to add/edit!</li>
                        <li><b>Memos</b>: free markdown text floating in layouts. Ideal for visual notes or content not related to just one table or column.</li>
                    </ul>
