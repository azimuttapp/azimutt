                        We expose your project data and Azimutt features through the global variable <code>azimutt</code>.
                        You can write JavaScript code to perform any automated task, like browsing your schema or manipulate your layout.
                        Here are some examples:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Show tables matching a regexp or having specific column</li>
                        <li>Transform your current layout into a mermaid graph</li>
                        <li>List tables with no indexes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's still experimental so a few thing may miss but let us know what you do with it and how we can improve it.</p>
