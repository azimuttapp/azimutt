                        All projects are private to the organization they belong.
                        But you may want to make them available to people not in the organization (great for feedback or documentation).

                    <p>
                        For this, you can create a <b>private link</b> and share it with anyone you want (or publicly).
                        Tokens have an expiration date and can be revoked at any time, so you are still in control.

                        This is also a great way to <b>embed a diagram</b> in your documentation üëçÔ∏è
