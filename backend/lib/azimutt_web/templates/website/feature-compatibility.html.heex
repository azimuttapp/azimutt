                        Azimutt has its own SQL parser, very flexible and tolerant to <span class="underline">work with most of SQL dialects</span>.
                        We tested it with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle dialects.
                        But if you have other databases like SQLite or MariaDB you should have no problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then we added a schema inference for json collections as well as nested columns; making document databases such as MongoDB and Couchbase explorable in Azimutt.
                        More will come but don't hesitate to ping us about this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we defined a JSON format to import schemas into Azimutt for whatever you want. If you can format it as entities and relations, you can explore it in Azimutt!
                        It could be a REST API (we may add Open Api support at some point) or anything else we didn't even though about ;)
                    </p>
