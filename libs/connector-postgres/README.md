# PostgreSQL connector

This library is able to connect to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), extract its schema and more...

It lists all schemas, tables, columns, relations and types and format them in a JSON Schema.

This library is made by [Azimutt](https://azimutt.app) to allow people to explore their PostgreSQL database.
It's accessible through the [Desktop app](../../desktop) (soon), the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azimutt) or even the website using the [gateway](../../gateway) server.

**Feel free to use it and even submit PR to improve it:**

- improve [PostgreSQL queries](./src/postgres.ts) (look at `getSchema` function)
