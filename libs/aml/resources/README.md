## Full

A database schema with all the AML features and several format for tests:

- tables, with schema, special name, alias
- attributes with name only, with special/keyword name/type, nullable, default, enum, nested
- primary key, simple/composite, name
- indexes, with/without name, simple/composite, unique
- checks, with/without predicate
- relations, inline/standalone, natural, from/to nested, composite, polymorphic, different cardinality
- doc, single/multi line, with #
- properties, with #, array, special, on entities/attributes/relations/types
- types, anonymous/alias/enum/strict/custom
- comments
- views, with definition

Still missing:

- primary key auto increment
- relation natural just on one side
