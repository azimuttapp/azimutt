# AMLv2: Azimutt Markup Language

[back to home](./README.md)


## Migration from v1

AMLv2 is coming 2 years after AMLv1 ([post](https://azimutt.app/blog/aml-a-language-to-define-your-database-schema) & [PR](https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt/pull/98) ^^).
During this time, we discovered a lot of new use cases and a few shortcomings (such as composite foreign keys).

This new iteration fixes some issues, improves consistency, and adds nice features such as [namespace](./namespace.md) and [properties](./properties.md).

We made it retro-compatible, so you can see warnings and fix them.


### Semantic changes

AMLv1 was built with relational databases in mind, too much in fact. So we had **tables**, **columns** and **foreign keys**.

We wanted to make AMLv2 more generic to better embrace the diversity of databases as well as other types of modeling, so we renamed:

- **table** to **entity**
- **column** to **attribute**
- **foreign key** to **relation**

As AML doesn't have a lot of syntax and keywords, it almost changes nothing in its syntax, except for foreign keys.


### Breaking changes

#### Change `fk` to `rel` for standalone relations

In AMLv1, you could define standalone relations like this:

```aml
fk events.created_by -> users.id
```

In AMLv2, you will define this with the `rel` keyword:

```aml
rel events.created_by -> users.id
```

**Why**:

- this is to align with semantic changes described above, some relations are not foreign keys, so it makes more sense like this


#### Change `fk` to `->` for inline relations

In AMLv1, you could define relations inline with the attribute such as:

```aml
posts
  id uuid pk
  author uuid fk users.id
```

For AMLv2, it needs to be changed to:

```aml
posts
  id uuid pk
  author uuid -> users.id
```

**Why**:

- we introduced [relation kinds](./relation.md#one-to-one): **one-to-one** (`--`), **one-to-many** (`->`) and **many-to-many** (`<>`), it fits well with the one-to-many `->` and would have been harder to keep obvious with the `fk` keyword
- we introduced [polymorphic relations](./relation.md#polymorphic-relation), the `->` giving the opportunity to specify the kind column: `rel events(item_id) -item_kind=User> users(id)`, which would have been harder to keep simple with the `fk` keyword
- we semantically moved from **foreign keys** to **relations** as some relations are not materialized by foreign keys. This is the case on document databases but also on relational databases for polymorphic relations or by the choice of developers (performance reasons or other).
- it's a closer definition to the standalone definition of relations, the end is identical: `-> users.id`


#### Change attribute ref from `table.column` to `table(column)`

In AMLv1, column references are defined with a `.` between the table and the column:

```aml
fk events.created_by -> users.id
```

In AMLv2, we use `()` instead to separate the entity from the attribute:

```aml
rel events(created_by) -> users(id)
```

**Why**:

- we introduced [composite relations](./relation.md#composite-relation): several columns pointing at several other columns, with the previous notation it was not clear how to specify them, now it's obvious: `rel events(user_id, role_id) -> user_roles(user_id, role_id)`
- the support of [nested attributes](./entity.md#nested-attribute) was introduced later with a specific separator (`:`) to avoid confusion between `schema.table.column` and `table.column.nested`, this was ugly and with this change we can fix this ðŸ˜Ž
- it's closer to the SQL syntax, which should make a lot of people more at home


#### Nested attributes are defined with `.` instead of `:`

In AMLv1, nested columns could be referenced like this:

```aml
fk events.details:user_id -> users.id
```

I guess almost nobody used it as it was not properly documented and you couldn't create nested columns with AMLv1 (they have to come from a database source).

In AMLv2, you can simply use the `.`, thanks to the attribute ref change with the `()` (no more confusion):

```aml
rel events(details.user_id) -> users(id)
```

**Why**:

- the previous syntax was an ugly hack to introduce unplanned feature, AMLv2 is the opportunity to fix it ^^
