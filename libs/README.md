# Azimutt libs

Shared libraries across several projects that could be published some time.
For now, we use `npm link` to import them in several projects (cli, desktop).

Examples:
- connector-couchbase
- connector-mongodb
- connector-mysql
- connector-postgres
- database-types
- parser-aml
- parser-sql
