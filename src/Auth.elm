{-| This function will run before any `protected` pages.

Here, you can provide logic on where to redirect if a user is not signed in. Here's an example:

    case shared.user of
        Just user ->
            ElmSpa.Provide user

        Nothing ->
            ElmSpa.RedirectTo Gen.Route.SignIn

-}
beforeProtectedInit : Shared.Model -> Request -> ElmSpa.Protected User Route
beforeProtectedInit shared _ =
    case shared.user of
        Just user ->
            ElmSpa.Provide user

        Nothing ->
            ElmSpa.RedirectTo Route.Login
