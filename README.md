Azimutt is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) targeting real world database schema (big & messy).

**Why building Azimutt?**

Databases existed for more than 40 years and despite a lot of tool around them, we couldn't find any providing a great exploration experience.

- **Database clients** focus on querying experience, with auto-completion and table/column lists but no visual help
- **ERDs** have a great diagram UI but fall short when schema is growing (real-world use cases)
- **Data catalogs** are primarily focused on data governance and lineage on big data sector

So we decided to built it üí™

Azimutt started as a schema exploration tool for databases with hundreds of tables, but now it has grown a lot:

![Azimutt roadmap](docs/_assets/azimutt-roadmap.png)

- Design your schema using [AML](docs/aml/README.md) for a fast diagramming
- Explore your database using search everywhere, display only useful tables/columns and follow relations
- Document it with layouts for use cases, features or team scopes and table/column notes
- Analyze it to discover inconsistencies and best practices

Azimutt goal is to be your ultimate tool to understand your database.

## Local development

Azimutt is built with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)/[elm-spa](https://www.elm-spa.dev) (editor) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)/[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) (backend & admin).

For local development you will need to set up the environment:

- install `npm`, [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html) & [elm-spa](https://www.elm-spa.dev)
- install [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) if needed
- install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download) with a user `postgres` and password `postgres`
- install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and run `pre-commit install` before committing
- run `npm run setup` to install dependencies and configure your environment

Then you can choose to launch either:

- `npm run ex:dev` for Elixir server (frontend will still be available through compiled files)
- `npm run elm:dev` for Elm/TypeScript frontend (useful when do develop on front)
- `npm run dev` for both with live reload

Now you can visit :

- [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) for the main app
- [`localhost:4000/api/v1/swagger`](http://localhost:4000/api/swagger) for the Swagger documentation
- [`localhost:4000/storybook`](http://localhost:4000/storybook) for the Storybook

‚ö†Ô∏è to launch the app you will need a few environment variables: `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

‚ö†Ô∏è Please see [Setup Stripe](#setup-stripe).

### Development commands

- `npm run elm:book` to launch the Elm design system

### Setup Stripe

#### Config

- Install [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and login with `stripe login`
- Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/webhook/stripe`
- Copy your webhook signing secret to your `.env`, it's look like (`whsec_XXX`)
- Go to [your Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) to obtain your API Key and copy it into `STRIPE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

#### Payments

When testing interactively, use a card number, such as `4242 4242 4242 4242`. Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.
Use a valid future date, such as `12/34`.
Use any three-digit CVC like `123` (four digits for American Express cards).
Use any value you like for other form fields.
