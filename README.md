Azimutt is a full-stack database exploration tool, from modern ERD made for real world databases (big & messy), to fast data navigation, but also documentation everywhere and whole database analysis.

[![Azimutt screenshot](docs/_assets/azimutt.png)](https://azimutt.app/gallery/gospeak)

**Why building Azimutt?**

Databases existed for more than 40 years and despite a lot of tool around them, we couldn't find any providing a great exploration experience.

- **Database clients** focus on querying experience, with auto-completion and table/column lists but no visual help
- **ERDs** have a great diagram UI but fall short when schema is growing (real-world use cases)
- **Data catalogs** are focused on data governance and lineage for data teams, miss relational db for developers

So we decided to built it ðŸ’ª

Azimutt started as a schema exploration tool for databases with hundreds of tables, but now it has grown a lot:

[![Azimutt roadmap](docs/_assets/roadmap.png)](https://mm.tt/map/2434161843?t=N2yWZj1pc1)

- Design your schema using [AML](docs/aml/README.md) for a fast diagramming
- Explore your database schema using search everywhere, display only useful tables/columns and follow relations
- Query your data like never before, follow foreign keys and display entities in diagram
- Document using table/column notes and tags and layouts and memos for use cases, features or team scopes
- Analyze it to discover inconsistencies and best practices to apply

Azimutt goal is to be your ultimate tool to understand your database.

## Self hosted

You can use our [Docker image](https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt/pkgs/container/azimutt) to easily deploy it. Here is the [full guide](INSTALL.md).

## Deploy on Heroku

You can use our Heroku template which includes Azimutt web app, a Postgres database, Stackhero S3 storage and Mailgun.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy)

After succeed deployment, you will need to configure config vars

```bash
# Replace with your app-name
HEROKU_APP=<app-name>

# Set PHX_HOST with the URL of the app
heroku config:set PHX_HOST=$(heroku info -s | grep "web_url" | sed 's|web_url=https://||; s|/$||')

# Copy Stackhero access key to S3_KEY_ID
heroku config:set S3_KEY_ID=$(heroku config:get S3_ROOT_ACCESS_KEY)

# Copy Stackhero secret key to S3_KEY_SECRET
heroku config:set S3_KEY_SECRET=$(heroku config:get S3_ROOT_SECRET_KEY)
```

Finally you will need to create the `azimutt` bucket on Stackhero:

- connect to Stackhero from your Heroku dashboard
- use values of `S3_ROOT_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_ROOT_SECRET_KEY` to log in
- create a bucket named `azimutt`

## Local development

Azimutt is built with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)/[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) (backend & admin) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)/[elm-spa](https://www.elm-spa.dev) (editor).

For local development you will need to set up the environment:

- install `pnpm`, [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html) & [elm-spa](https://www.elm-spa.dev)
- install [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) if needed (use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com))
- install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download), create a user `postgres` with password `postgres` and a database `azimutt_dev` (see `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` later)
- install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and run `pre-commit install` before committing
- copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adapt values
- source your environment and install dependencies: `source .env && npm run setup`
- you can now start the Azimutt server: `source .env && npm start`
- and finally navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) ðŸŽ‰
- you can login with `admin@azimutt.app` email & `admin` password

Other things:

- API documentation is accessible at [`/api/v1/swagger`](http://localhost:4000/api/v1/swagger)
- You can use `pnpm --filter "azimutt-editor" run book` to start Elm design system & components, and access it with [localhost:4002](http://localhost:4002)

### command semantics

We have a lot of projects with a lot of commands, here is how they are structured:

- each project has its own commands (mostly npm but also elixir), the root project has global commands to launch them using a prefix
- `setup` is a one time command to install what is required
- `install` download dependencies, should be run when new ones are added
- `start` launch project in dev mode
- `test` allows to run tests
- `format` allows to run execute code formatting
- `lint` allows to run execute linters
- `build` generate compilation output
- `build:docker` same as `build` but in the docker image (paths are different ðŸ˜•)
- `update` bumps library versions

### Development commands

- `pnpm --filter "azimutt-editor" run book` to launch the Elm design system

### Setup Stripe

#### Config

- Install [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and login with `stripe login`
- Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/webhook/stripe`
- Copy your webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` variable in your `.env` file (looks like `whsec_...`)
- Go to [your Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) to obtain your API Key and copy it into `STRIPE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file (looks like: `sk_test_...`)

#### Payments

When testing interactively, use a card number, such as `4242 4242 4242 4242`. Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.
Use a valid future date, such as `12/34`.
Use any three-digit CVC like `123` (four digits for American Express cards).
Use any value you like for other form fields.
